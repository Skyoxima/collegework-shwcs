    Throughout my college career, I've put in considerable effort in learning
    the material through practical assignments. To me, this was Engineering. I
    didn't mind spending time on these assignments, it was always a learning
    experience working on them.<br />With this showcase, I want to display
    almost everything that I've worked on over these years. It is a window into
    my journey and my work process, I hope it is enjoyable to see.

    Once a project is loaded, the core is laid out as the following:
